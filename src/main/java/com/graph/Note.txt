    Adj List
    Several Ways to represent adj list
    1)
        It can be list of list of int
        index of outer list is the nodeId and its corresponding value is the list containing all reachable nodes from that one.
    2)
        Map<integer, List<edge>>
        integer is the node id, and list of edge are the edges reachable from that node
